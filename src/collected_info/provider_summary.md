## Research Methodology

This data was collected using the provider_info_collector.js script which:
1. Attempts to access public API endpoints without authentication
2. Scrapes documentation websites when direct API access isn't available
3. Verifies endpoint accessibility and documents rate limitations
4. Detects special capabilities like search and multimodal features

For comprehensive research, multiple MCP servers were utilized:
- Context7 for detailed API documentation research
- Memory MCP for storing and retrieving research findings
- Fetch MCP for web-based verification and additional research
- Regular tools for data collection and processing
