# Copilot Task: Analyze and Act on Pull Request Conversation

The following content is a full **GitHub pull request conversation page**, including:

- Reviewer comments and summaries
- UI/menu artifacts and platform noise
- Auto-generated summaries (CodeRabbit, Gemini, etc.)
- Context about the repo, changed files, and PR metadata

## 🔧 Your Mission:

1. **Ignore all irrelevant GitHub UI content** — menus, avatars, timestamps, etc.
2. Focus only on **reviewer and bot comments**, including summaries and suggestions.
3. Extract only **clear, actionable, and helpful feedback**.

## 🚀 What to Do:

- ✅ Automatically apply all low-effort, high-value suggestions (under 5 minutes work).
- ❌ Do NOT ask for permission to apply them.
- ❗If a suggestion is **vague, unclear, or major work**, then:
   - Do NOT implement it now.
   - Instead, insert a TODO or FIXME comment describing the task for future review.

## 📜 Special Rules:

- 🧠 Use your own judgment — you are authorized to filter out noise.
- 📘 Use bot summaries (CodeRabbit, Gemini, etc.) as context, but trust only where clear.
- 📌 Ensure you scan and consider all comments until the very end.
- 🛠 If a suggestion involves multiple steps, only implement the simplest portion and defer the rest as future work.

## 🔄 Output:

Make improvements directly where possible. Add `TODO:` markers for tasks that need further work, but don’t block on anything.
