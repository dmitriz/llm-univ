# RESUME COPILOT TASK (Claude Sonnet 4)

You were processing a GitHub pull request conversation for actionable feedback and implementation. You’ve already begun and paused mid-way.

Please resume from where you left off:

- ✅ Continue scanning through the **entire pull request conversation**
- ✅ Apply any remaining **low-effort, high-impact suggestions**
- 🔁 For complex ones, annotate with `TODO:` or `FIXME:` in the code
- 🚫 Do not ask for my confirmation — continue working autonomously
