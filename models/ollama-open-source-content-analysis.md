# Open-Source LLMs for Local Content Analysis (Ollama-Compatible)

## Overview and Requirements

Running large language models (LLMs) locally for tasks like text **summarization**, information **extraction**, and general content **analysis** ensures strong privacy (no data leaves your machine). To choose an effective model, we must balance capability with hardware limits. The target system has a 13th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU (with integrated Iris Xe graphics) and **64 GB RAM**, so it can host moderately sized models but lacks a high-end GPU. The user prefers models under **5 GB** (ideally \~2 GB) in size to conserve memory and improve speed. This generally means focusing on models around 7–8 billion parameters or smaller, using heavy **quantization** to shrink memory footprint. All recommended models are **open-source** (permissive licenses) and available via the **Ollama** ecosystem for easy local deployment.

**Key selection criteria:** The models below are instruction-tuned (chat/instruct variants) which makes them well-suited for **summarization** of documents, answering questions, and extracting information from text upon request. They are optimized for **efficient local inference** through quantization, and several support **extended context windows** to handle long documents (e.g. tens of thousands of tokens), useful for analyzing large content with no data leakage to external servers.

## Quantization for Efficient Local Inference

To run LLMs on modest hardware, **quantization** is essential. Quantization reduces the precision of model weights (e.g. from 16-bit to 4-bit integers), dramatically lowering memory usage and enabling faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. By default, **Ollama uses 4-bit quantized models** for efficiency. For example, an 8B model in 4-bit requires only \~4–5 GB of memory, whereas the same model at full 16-bit precision would need \~16 GB. In fact, Meta's Llama 70B can be squeezed into \~40 GB with 4-bit quantization, while a smaller 8B model fits in \~4.7 GB.

Common quantization levels include **4-bit (Q4)** which is a sweet spot for size vs. accuracy, as well as 8-bit (higher accuracy, \~2× larger) and even 2-bit or 3-bit in cutting-edge cases (ultra-small size with some quality trade-off). Ollama's model library often provides multiple quantized variants; for instance, "8B-instruct-q4\_0" (\~4.7 GB) vs "8B-instruct-q8\_0" (\~8.5 GB). In practice, a **4-bit quantized** model around 7–8B parameters will be \~3–5 GB in size, meeting the user's requirements. All the models below can be downloaded in 4-bit **GGUF** format for Ollama (and some support even more aggressive quantization like Q3 or Q2 if needed to approach \~2 GB). This enables running them entirely on CPU or modest GPU with acceptable speed. *(Note: quantization has only a **minimal impact on performance** for these models, so the accuracy remains high despite the smaller size.)*

## Top Ollama-Compatible Models for Local Content Management

### IBM Granite 3.2 - 8B Instruct (Apache 2.0)

IBM's **Granite-3.2** is an 8-billion-parameter model designed for enterprise-grade reasoning and **instruction following**. It's fine-tuned to handle a wide range of tasks and has a **long context window** (up to **128k tokens**) for processing or summarizing lengthy documents. Granite excels at **summarization**, text **extraction**, classification, Q\&A, and even code or tool usage. A unique feature is its controllable "thinking" mode: it can perform chain-of-thought reasoning for complex instructions, which IBM reports allows it to **match or exceed the reasoning performance of much larger models (GPT-4-class and Claude 3.5)** when enabled. Despite these capabilities, Granite-3.2 remains efficient: the 8B model quantized to 4-bit is about **4.9 GB**, fitting under the 5 GB limit. (A smaller 2B version \~1.5 GB is also available, but with reduced accuracy.) Granite-3.2 is fully open-source (Apache 2.0 license) and integrates easily with Ollama (`ollama run granite3.2:8b`). Its strong instruction-tuning and long-context support make it ideal for private document analysis – e.g. summarizing reports or extracting key points – without any data leaving your machine.

### Mistral 7B Instruct (v0.3) – 7.3B by Mistral AI (Apache 2.0)

**Mistral 7B Instruct** is a 7.3B-parameter model that has emerged as one of the most **efficient and powerful small LLMs**. Trained on a massive dataset and released under Apache 2.0, Mistral 7B famously **outperforms Meta's LLaMA-2 13B** model across many benchmarks despite having half the parameters. In fact, it even rivals or surpasses some 30B+ models on certain tasks. The v0.3 instruct version is tuned for following user instructions in natural language, making it adept at tasks like summarization ("TL;DR"-style condensations), question-answering, and information extraction from text. It also has optimization features (Grouped-Query and Sliding Window Attention) that allow a **context window up to 32k tokens**, enabling summarization of long documents or transcripts. In practical use, Mistral 7B is known for its **strong general-purpose NLP performance** (it can handle coding queries, reasoning puzzles, etc., in addition to standard text tasks). Community evaluations show it achieves high summarization quality – in one test its summaries scored similarly to an 8B Llama-based model on a GPT-4 evaluation scale. When quantized to 4-bit, Mistral's 7B model is around **3.5–4 GB**, which runs comfortably on a 64 GB RAM system. This model is available via Ollama (`ollama pull mistral`), and is widely praised for offering **Llama-2-13B level performance in a fraction of the size**, making it an excellent choice for local content analysis tasks.

### Alibaba Qwen-7B (Qwen2.5 7B Instruct) – 7B (Apache 2.0)

**Qwen-7B** is an open-source 7-billion-parameter model from Alibaba Cloud's Qwen series, known for its strong performance and multilingual capabilities. The latest Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model was trained on an enormous corpus (up to 18 trillion tokens) and supports an extended context of **up to 128k tokens**. It is instruction-tuned for following user queries. Qwen-7B excels across a variety of tasks: it has **multilingual** understanding (English, Chinese and many other languages) and handles reasoning, math, and coding surprisingly well for its size. In internal evaluations, **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct outperforms other models of similar size** (like Google's Gemma 9B or Meta's Llama 3.1 8B) on virtually all tasks. Notably, it demonstrates strengths in complex domains – for example, it scored very highly on math (MATH benchmark \~75) and coding (HumanEval) for a 7B model. For summarization and content analysis, Qwen's robust training means it produces coherent and accurate summaries, and it can extract information or answer questions from text in multiple languages. The model is available through Ollama (often under the name `qwen2.5-7b-instruct`). When quantized to 4-bit, it's roughly **4 GB** in size, similar to others. Given its **high evaluation scores and 128K context** window, Qwen-7B is an excellent choice if you need a versatile, multilingual model that runs locally without data leaks.

### DeepSeek R1 – 7B "Open Reasoning" Model

**DeepSeek-R1 7B** is a newer entrant focused on advanced reasoning and long-context understanding. It's part of a family of "open reasoning models" that achieve performance approaching leading-edge proprietary models. DeepSeek-R1 is fully open-source and comes in sizes from 1.5B up to a massive MoE version; the **7B variant** is of interest as it can be run on local hardware. Despite the small size, it has been tuned to perform complex reasoning and "think step-by-step," which can benefit tasks like summarizing while preserving detailed facts or performing structured extraction. One standout feature is its **extremely long context window (128K tokens)** across all model sizes. This means DeepSeek-7B can ingest very large documents (hundreds of pages) in one go and generate summaries or analyses that take into account the entire context. In the Ollama library, DeepSeek-R1 7B quantized is about **4.7 GB** (Q4 format), fitting the criteria. Users have found that DeepSeek's quality on complicated queries and multi-step reasoning is excellent – it was developed to **approach "GPT-4 level" reasoning performance** within an open model. For content management tasks, this model would be useful when you need to analyze or summarize large knowledge sources or perform chain-of-thought extraction of insights. It may be slightly slower due to the long context handling, but it ensures you can work with big texts entirely offline. (If shorter contexts are fine, other models like Granite or Mistral might be a bit more optimized; but DeepSeek is a great option when **maximum context** and strong reasoning are required.)
